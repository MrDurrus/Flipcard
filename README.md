### App Description
A simplified version of a flashcard that lets you toggle between a question and its answer.

### App Walk-though
One can start the app through the app selection window on the device. The app should start with the title in the top left "Flipcard", along with the question "Can you read this?". The user can tap on the question to see the answer, "Yes!". The user can then tap on the answer to go back to the question.
